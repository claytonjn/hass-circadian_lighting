# Circadian Lighting [[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) Component]
## Stay healthier and sleep better by syncing your lights with natural daylight to maintain your circadian rhythm!

Circadian Lighting slowly synchronizes your color changing lights with the regular naturally occuring color temperature of the sky throughout the day. This gives your environment a more natural feel, with cooler hues during the midday and warmer tints near twilight and dawn.

In addition, Circadian Lighting can set your lights to a nice cool white at 1% in “Sleep” mode, which is far brighter than starlight but won’t reset your circadian rhythm or break down too much rhodopsin in your eyes.
